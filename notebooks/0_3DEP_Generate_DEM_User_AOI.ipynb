    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States Geological Survey's 3-D Elevation Program (3DEP) is collecting high-quality light detection and ranging (lidar) data over the conterminous U.S., Hawaii, and the U.S territories. Data acquisition is ongoing, with over 1800 3DEP datasets consisting of more than 42 trillion points covering an area of greater than 6.5 million $km^{2}$ already available for use. Data are hosted and publically available in Entwine Point Tile (EPT) format in an<a href=\"https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/\"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 public bucket</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific features of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The notebook reads in the bounds of the Worldview imagery over which we would like to generate a DSM\n",
    "\n",
    "2. API request to <a href=\"https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/\"> Amazon Web Services (AWS) EPT (Entwine Point Tile) S3 bucket</a> returns 3DEP point cloud data within user-defined AOI for subsequent processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. PDAL processing pipelines are available for specifying point cloud resolution, filtering, reclassifying, and reprojecting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) with user-specifed resolution, gridding method, and file type."

Selecting the \"Full\" option will return all points in the quad (this number can be quite large, depending on the size of the AOI). Selecting any of the other options for resolution will return the appropriate number of points to ensure at least one lidar point per Nth meter (where N is the chosen resolution). The Entwine Point Tile (EPT) file format utilizes an octree structure for the point cloud, and the chosen resolution defines how deep in the octree to request points to obtain the specified resolution. This depth, and total number points varies drastically based on a number of parameters including local topography and vegetation. Therefore, the 'resolution' paramater and the total point count do not scale linearly. In other words, specifying a resolution of 2m will likely return far less than half of the number of points returned with 'full' resolution. The estimate of the full poin total provided is not exact, but should give the user some idea of how many points to expect the resultant point cloud to contain. \n",
