# Assorted notebooks
* Some of these are for figure generation
* Some were for debugging
* Many likely have broken filepaths or obsolete source datsets, but should have code snippets that will still be useful

# DeepDEM
DeepDEM is a project about using deep learning to refine Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) generated from high resolution optical imagery.

This work is inspired by the [ResDepth](https://github.com/prs-eth/ResDepth/) work of [Stucker et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271621003075), and extends it for use over natural terrain, and updates the codebase to use robust machine learning libraries including [torchgeo](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/) and [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/)
